# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a comprehensive web-based GUI for the Atalanta circuit debugging tool, transforming the current CLI-only Docker container into a user-friendly, VS Code-like interface. The solution provides a single-command Docker deployment that includes both the legacy C++ Atalanta binary and a modern Next.js web interface, with persistent data storage and zero configuration required from users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a circuit designer, I want to run a single Docker command and immediately access a web-based GUI for Atalanta, so that I can use the tool without complex installation or CLI knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs `docker run -p 3000:3000 atalanta-gui:latest` THEN the system SHALL start both the Next.js web server and make the Atalanta CLI available within the same container
2. WHEN the container starts THEN the system SHALL automatically create and attach a named Docker volume for persistent data storage without requiring user configuration
3. WHEN a user navigates to `http://localhost:3000` THEN the system SHALL display a fully functional web interface
4. WHEN the container is stopped and restarted THEN the system SHALL preserve all user files and project data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a circuit designer, I want a VS Code-like file management interface, so that I can easily create, open, and organize my circuit files within the web browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the web interface THEN the system SHALL display a file explorer panel similar to VS Code's sidebar
2. WHEN the user clicks "New File" THEN the system SHALL allow creation of new .bench circuit files with syntax highlighting
3. WHEN the user clicks "Open Folder" THEN the system SHALL display the container's file system and allow navigation to select folders
4. WHEN the user selects a file THEN the system SHALL open it in a tabbed editor interface with appropriate syntax highlighting for .bench files
5. WHEN the user right-clicks on files or folders THEN the system SHALL provide context menu options for rename, delete, and copy operations
6. WHEN the user uploads files THEN the system SHALL support drag-and-drop file upload functionality for .bench files

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a circuit designer, I want an integrated terminal within the web interface, so that I can run Atalanta commands and see their output without leaving the browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the terminal panel THEN the system SHALL provide a fully functional bash terminal interface within the web browser
2. WHEN the user types `atalanta` commands THEN the system SHALL execute them against the containerized Atalanta binary and display real-time output
3. WHEN Atalanta generates output files THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the file explorer to show new files
4. WHEN the user runs long-running commands THEN the system SHALL support command interruption (Ctrl+C) and maintain terminal session state
5. WHEN multiple users access the same container THEN the system SHALL provide isolated terminal sessions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a circuit designer, I want a graphical interface for running Atalanta operations, so that I can execute common tasks without memorizing CLI commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a .bench file THEN the system SHALL display a "Run Atalanta" button or panel with common operation options
2. WHEN the user clicks "Generate Test Patterns" THEN the system SHALL execute the appropriate Atalanta command with the selected file and display progress
3. WHEN Atalanta execution completes THEN the system SHALL automatically open the generated output files (.test, .vec, .log) in new editor tabs
4. WHEN the user configures Atalanta options THEN the system SHALL provide form inputs for common parameters (backtrack limits, compaction mode, etc.)
5. WHEN operations are running THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators and allow cancellation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a circuit designer, I want to view and analyze Atalanta output files with enhanced formatting, so that I can easily understand test results and fault coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens .test files THEN the system SHALL display them with formatted tables and syntax highlighting
2. WHEN the user opens .vec files THEN the system SHALL provide a structured view of test vectors with input/output mapping
3. WHEN the user opens .log files THEN the system SHALL highlight important statistics and error messages
4. WHEN viewing large output files THEN the system SHALL implement virtual scrolling for performance
5. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL provide summary statistics in a dedicated results panel

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a circuit designer, I want the web interface to work seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes, so that I can access my work from various environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the interface on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL provide responsive layout that adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
2. WHEN panels become too narrow THEN the system SHALL automatically collapse or stack interface elements appropriately
3. WHEN the user resizes browser windows THEN the system SHALL maintain usable proportions for all interface panels
4. WHEN using touch devices THEN the system SHALL support touch gestures for file operations and terminal interaction

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the containerized solution to be production-ready with proper error handling and logging, so that I can deploy it reliably in various environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the container starts THEN the system SHALL perform health checks on both the web server and Atalanta binary availability
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and display user-friendly error messages in the web interface
3. WHEN the container runs out of disk space THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle the situation and notify users
4. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL maintain local functionality and attempt to reconnect automatically
5. WHEN the container is deployed THEN the system SHALL include proper security headers and input validation for all web endpoints

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a circuit designer, I want to manage multiple projects and recent files easily, so that I can quickly switch between different circuit designs and maintain my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user works with files THEN the system SHALL maintain a "Recent Files" list accessible from the main interface
2. WHEN the user creates or opens projects THEN the system SHALL support project-based organization with workspace folders
3. WHEN the user switches between projects THEN the system SHALL preserve the state of open files and terminal sessions per project
4. WHEN the user searches for files THEN the system SHALL provide fuzzy search functionality across all files in the current workspace
5. WHEN managing large projects THEN the system SHALL support file filtering and search within the file explorer
